# Consideration:

Please consider my late submit for the assignment because of my misunderstanding of the deadline i delayed to submit this assignment.
Another thing,

> In deployed site auto sync feature of local cart to users account is not working due to firebase issue. In local dev server this feature works perfectly. Because of the deadline passed i could not able to fix the issue. Please consider my hark work and dedication to the assignment.
